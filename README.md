# nickeffect
This is a version of a screen saver module I originally wrote for the BackSpace screen saver app on NeXTSTEP, in the early 90s. Much later I rewrote it for OS X and enhanced it with multiple geometries, which is the version provided here. 

The original name was NickSpace which made sense in the context of BackSpace; but when I did the rewrite it seemed annoyingly similar to MySpace so I renamed it to NickEffect. Anyway, both versions are named after my friend [Nick](http://harkeraquila.com/13756/features/french-teacher-nicholas-manjoine-finds-inner-peace-in-yoga/) because it was originally inspired by some whiteboard doodlings of his.
